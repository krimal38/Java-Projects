## Assignment Objectives
- Write a program which simulates a computer network.
- Create and use a _graph_ data structure.
- Create and use a _hash table_ data structure.
- Apply basic knowledge of Big-O trade offs.

## Assignment Overview
Professional code often uses existing libraries to quickly prototype interesting programs. You are going to use 2-3 established libraries to quickly develop the internal representation of two advanced data structures (a graph and a hash table) and simulate a simple computer network.

The three libraries you are going to use are:
1. Your previous project code - You have written a number of simple data structures in this class and you are welcome to continue using these as part of this project.
2. The Java Collections Framework - This is a collection of existing simple data structures (lists, queues, etc.) which can form the basis for more advanced data structures.
3. A subset of [JUNG](http://jung.sourceforge.net/) (Java Universal Network/Graph Framework) - This library provides a lot of cool visualization tools for graphs: automatic layouts for graphs, an easy interface for creating/editing graphs, and much more.

## Tasks Overview

There are **5** tasks in this assignment. It is suggested that you implement these tasks in the given order:

- Task 1: Examine the JCF Classes (0%)
- Task 2: Read the Provided Code Base (0%)
- Task 3: Implement a Directed Graph Class to Support the Network Structure (60%)
- Task 4: Implement a Hash Table Class to Support the Network Routing (20%)
- Task 5: Finish Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm in the Simulator (20%)

See the [Examples Page](EXAMPLES.md "") for what the simulator should be able to do when you are done, and then see the [Task Details Page](TASKS.md "") for a walk-through of each specific task.

Need a schedule?
- You've got 2.5 weeks.
- You have other classes with final exams/projects.
- Assume you want to spend the last week doing the EC and getting additional help.
- Keeping those things in mind, fill in the following:
  - Week 0 (11/05-11/10): _______________________________ (first weekend)
  - Week 1 (11/11-11/17): _______________________________
  - Week 2 (11/18-11/24): _______________________________ (extra credit for early submission...)

## Rules and Grading
As with all projects in CS310, we have some rules (see [Rules Page](RULES.md "")) and a grading rubric (see [Rubric Page](GRADING.md "")).
